                Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard. Each player controls 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it is in check (under threat of capture) and there is no way to escape the threat.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                Players take turns moving their pieces across the board according to specific rules for each piece. The king can move one square in any direction, while the queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Rooks move horizontally or vertically any number of squares, bishops move diagonally any number of squares, knights move in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular), and pawns move forward one square (or two squares on their first move) and capture diagonally.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                Chess involves strategic planning, tactical maneuvering, and anticipation of the opponent's moves. Players aim to control the center of the board, develop their pieces, and create threats against the opponent's king while protecting their own.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                The game can end in several ways: checkmate (one player's king is in a position where it cannot escape capture), stalemate (one player has no legal moves and their king is not in check), resignation (one player voluntarily gives up because they believe they cannot win), or a draw (mutual agreement, insufficient material to checkmate, threefold repetition of position, or the 50-move rule without a pawn move or capture).
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                Chess is a timeless game with a rich history and has been played for centuries, evolving into a competitive sport, an intellectual pursuit, and a means of social interaction. It offers endless possibilities for strategic exploration and continues to captivate players of all ages and backgrounds around the world.

                "Monopoly" is a classic board game designed for two to eight players, where the objective is to become the wealthiest player by buying, renting, and trading properties. The game is played on a square board divided into a series of spaces representing properties, utilities, railroads, and other locations.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                At the beginning of the game, players receive a set amount of money and take turns rolling dice to move around the board. When a player lands on an unowned property, they have the option to purchase it. If they choose not to buy it, the property is auctioned to the highest bidder. Once a player owns a property, they can collect rent from opponents who land on it.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                Players can enhance their properties by building houses and hotels, which increase the rent charged to opponents who land on those properties. The goal is to bankrupt opponents by forcing them to pay large sums of money when landing on owned properties.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                In addition to properties, there are also Chance and Community Chest cards, which provide players with opportunities to gain or lose money, move to different spaces on the board, or perform other actions that can affect gameplay.
                </p>
                <p class="text_page">
                The game continues until only one player remains solvent, at which point they are declared the winner. Monopoly is known for its competitive nature, strategic decision-making, and elements of luck, making it a popular game for families and friends to play together. Over the years, numerous variations and themed editions of Monopoly have been released, adding new twists and features while maintaining the core gameplay mechanics.
